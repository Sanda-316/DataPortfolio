## 📁 About Me

👩🏾‍💻 Just your friendly neighborhood data enthusiast, crunching numbers and chasing insights!  
I’m all about turning messy data into “aha!” moments. Whether it's slicing cricket stats or decoding panic attack patterns, I live for digging into the data and telling stories with it—charts, dashboards, queries and all. Always learning and forever curious.  
Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sisanda-m-sibanda-7a2b941aa) and talk all things data (or cricket, or T-shirts... you’ll see why)! 🏏👕📊
